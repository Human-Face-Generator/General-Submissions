# Project-Statement-
Our project offers human face generation which do not exist in the real world, by using the ability of AI to generate fake visuals .The algorithm behind it, is trained on a huge dataset of real images, then uses a type of neural network known as a generative adversarial network (or GAN) to fabricate new examples. In essence, two neural networks contest with each other in a game (where one agent's gain is another agent's loss).The generative network generates candidates while the discriminative network evaluates them.

Most people do not understand how good AIs will be at synthesizing images in the future
The scope of image generation via AI is tremendous
This could save small businesses as well as huge enterprises a substantial share of their incomes spent on marketing which involves huge transactions with modelling agencies, since here a random face generator could synthesize new faces which would not cost the company big bucks and lead to no copyright issues
 Another important application of face synthesizing is in design and prototyping. This has provided flexibility to front end developers and UI designers while adding human faces to their project.
Our project is also capable of playing a vital role in the gaming industry. AI based face synthesizer will prove to revolutionize the gaming industry, saving time and efforts of game developers and hence generate greater revenues. Programs like this could create endless virtual worlds, as well as help designers and illustrators.
